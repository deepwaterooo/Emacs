* Updates
- haskell-mode ready for use.
- org-mode minted works with pygments to get syntax highlight for source codes, including chinese characters comments.
- Screenshot works. 
- Rebounded emacs keys for convenience for alt, commands. 
- keybounded "Command- " for both mac and emacs for wubi input so I don't have to rethink whenever I need switch (and the key bounds are easy to use). 
- babel org-mode so I don't have to copy from specific babeled source org-mode files in order for chinese characters to work. 
- company-mode needs more work to imoprove efficiency.
- As I am getting more and more modes in init file, will need to initialize emacs accroding to modes pretty soon. Will find a good time to work on this one when tetris 3d is done. 
- 
- gets csharp-mode {} works for String s = "{}", works for int [] a = {_cursor_} together with autopair global mode; but not for scope yet public void foo() {_cursor_}.

* TODOs
  - configure and organize emacs better so that it won't take too much time when initializing.
