a new emacs 24.5 configuration for my temporatery use. 

So far leave it this way cause I have other higher priority tasks want to be finished first. Will combe back to this repository later when I get chance. 

1. will clearn this repository, to make it nice and neat. 

2. configure and organize emacs better so that it won't take too much time when initializing.
