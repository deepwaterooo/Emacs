\section{Updates}
\label{sec-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Luck we have git, so after a reasonable amount of search, I checkout previous versions and got java-mode all back to work full functionally for autocomplete + yasnippet mode.
\item finished one hour earlier, figure out git.
\item will work on my interested projects, and do further search next time when I have issues for emacs. And hopefully next time would be my beloved cousin to guide me how to debug emacs at run-time. I look forward to that day.
\item will work on tetris 3d for some time tonight, and make a commitment before tomorrow morning.
\item 
\item got java-mode autocomplete \& yasnippet \& yasnippet-bundle do not work properly as before any more. As an Emacs heavy-user, without Emacs autocomplete \&\& yasnippets working, it is impossible for me to write any codes. Most of the java-mode snippets are based on previous linux system. Have worked on it for two hours, will get this problem solved before processing tetris 3d. org-mode autocomplete funcs as before.
\item The intial reason was in the moring, tried snippets fo \&\& foo, made another ptv, and then autoindent snippets. It worked perfect in the moring, and I have byte-compiled yasnippet-bundle.el file, then in the afternoon, when I started MatrixState.java (tetris 3d) thinking how am I going to manipulate my matrix, I realized my emacs got messy now.
\item I may spend tonight \& tomorrow morning (as this evening I may not have clear enough mind to solve my half-understand lisp emacs configuration problems).
\item the source reason could be a wrongly replaced lisp-interactively-p in yasnippet-bundle.el file. but I have to check out, and for this time, I may be challegeed with run-time lisp debugging (Since using mac and installed emacs 24.5.1, I haven’t really devote time on it much yet except latex searched once. I will have to learn and debug it through this time then).
\item Make a Commit for later References (has set latex exec path differently since last).
\item 
\item MacTex (2.5G version) + (Emacs)Acutex +  (Emacs)org-mode for Mac Latex environment, emacs export to pdf supporting Chinese.
\end{itemize}

\section{TODOs}
\label{sec-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item configure and organize emacs better so that it won't take too much time when initializing.
\end{itemize}
